== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this a standalone classified ads plugin? =

No it is not. [WPAdverts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) must be installed and activated for the AddonSuite to work.

= Does the AddonSuite work with the free WPAdverts version? =

Yes, it works with the free version of WPAdverts.

= Is the AddonSuite available in my language? =

Basically, because the AddonSuite is prepared for translations. We recommend [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) to translate the AddonSuite to your own language. The AddonSuite comes standard in English and a translation in German.
